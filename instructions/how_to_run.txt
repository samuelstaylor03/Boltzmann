### INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM ###

On a linux machine (or WSL), ensure that gfortran and make are installed.
If not use the commands:
    $   apt install gfortran
    $   apt install make

from the home directory 'boltzmann', use the following command:
    $   make
This will create the 'release' directory which is where all of the object and mod files will be stored
as well as the executable file 'main'

Ensure that a dft.inp file is in the directory that you are in when you run the executable.
For example, you can copy a dft.inp file from the input folder to the home directory and then run the executable from release
EXAMPLE COMMANDS:
    $   cp input/c2h2/dft.inp .
    $   ./release/main 300 1

If you want to clean-up and 'un-compile' the code: use either of the following commands:
    $   make clean
    $   make cleaner

make clean will remove all the .o and .mod files as well as the executable
make cleaner will remove the entire release folder
